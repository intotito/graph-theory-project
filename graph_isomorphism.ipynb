    "# Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going further with the Graph Isomorphism problem, it is important to delve further into the definition of graphs. A Graph is an abstract data type that can be used to represent complex, non-linear relationships between objects. A graph can be represented by $G$ where $G = (V,E)$. For the Graph $G$, $V$ is a set of Vertices and $E$ is a set of edges(B. Miller and D. Ranum, 2018). Each Edge is a tuple $(v,w)$ where $w, v \\in V$ . From this definition it can be concluded that graphs can be represented as a set of Vertices and Nodes and all relevant logic and set theories can also be applied to graphs. \n",
    "Graphs are normally represented diagramatically using circles as node and interconnecting lines as edges. This is a very convinient and intuitive way of representing graphs and relationship between  the vertices (edges). However, it is important to stress that graphs are never about the diagram itself but what it represents. Graphs with limited number of nodes are suitable for graphical representation. This cannot be said about graphs with hundreds or maybe thousands of edges which is impractical to represent diagramatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some important terms used for graphs are listed below\n",
    "- When two nodes are connected by an edge, they are called neighbours. \n",
    "- The degree of a node is the number of other nodes that it is connected to (i.e. the number of neighbours that it has). \n",
    "- A loop is an edge that connecgs a node to itself\n",
    "- A cycle is a closed path, i.e. a path that starts and ends at the same node (and no node is visited more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph can be thought as a data structure that is used to describe relationships between entities. It can represent a relationship or lack of it between any distinguishable and identifiable entities which can be abstract or real data or idea.\n",
    "Graphs have become ubiquitous in the computing world owing to their ability to not only provide abstractions to real life sceneiros but also demonstrate complicated relationships with ease (Ruchi Nayyar, 2022). \n",
    "For context, graphs could be used to model social networking problems to show interconnectivity between different users. Each user in the network can be modelled as vertice and relationship like 'following each other' as an edge between the nodes (users). Also transportation network is another classical graph problem showing the interconnectivity between cities and the lack of them. The Internet could also be modelled as a graph where routers represent the nodes while an edge shows that a given set of routers are connected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be broadly categorized into directed and undirected graphs. A graph is said to be undirected when the relationship between the nodes is symmetric. Where there exist an asymmetric relationsihp between the vertices then the graph can be said to be directed. Example of real world directed graph problem would be road networks where some motorway has a one-way traffic."

    "### Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adjency matrix of a graph is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. It is probably the most popular and intuitive way of representing a graph and work reasonably well for all application. A graph with $n$ nodes will have an adjacency matrix of the order $n \\times n$. On this note we could say that an Adjacency Matrix for a given graph $G = \\{V, E\\}$ with a set of vertices $V = \\{v_1, v_2\\, ...., v_n\\}$ is a square $n \\times n$ such that its element $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is an edge between $V_i$ and $V_j$. \n",
    "The Adjacency matrix of a graph is an important property of a graph which represents the node to edge mapping/configuration of a graph. \n",
    "It determines which pair of vertices are connected with a node/arc. \n",
    "To produce the Adjacency Matrix of a graph, the vertices are lsited in an arbitrary order where the columns and rows are labelled in the same order (Left to Right for columns & Top to Down for rows). For a pair of vertices that has an edge between them, the value of `1` is given to the cell where the first vertice on the row intersects with the second vertice on the column, otherwise the value is `0`. Since the vertices of a graph a just a set of abstract data types, the ordering of the vertices shouldn't matter. This is to say that if the ordering of the vertices are changed in a consistent way(the order is changed both for the column and row in the same way) we should end up with the 'same' representation of the graph. \n",
    "This implies that a graph can take on different form and still considered the same graph.\n",

Entry that has 1 on the matrix represents an edge between the vertice listed on the row and the vertice listed on the column, while a value of 0 shows that no edge exist between the vertices. As can be seen from the matrix, an adjacency matrix of a graph without a loop (A vertices connected with itself) will have the values of 0 on the main diagonal."

Adjacency List is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a graph, where each list contain describes the set of neighbours for a given vertex. It is very efficient in the sense that for a given graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $e$ edges, it will require $n + m$ entries to represent the graph. Contrast this with adjacency matrix that requires $n^{2}$ entries to represent the graph, this can have a far reaching implication in terms of space complexity of an algorithm. \n"

    "Deciding whether two graphs are structurally identical or isomorphic is a classical computational problem that has been studied from the early days of computing. Graph Isomorphism is one of a small number of natural algorithnmatic problems with unsettled complexity statue in the P / NP theory (László Babai, 1998). It is said not expected to be NP-complete, yet not known to be solvable in polynomial time. A problem is said to be NP-complete when the correctness or lack of it for every solution of the problem can be verified quickly and a solution could be found by trying all possible solutions.\n",

This relationship is described as `structure preserving bijection`. For a directed graph, the magnitude and or direction of the edges connecting adjacent nodes $u$ and $v$ of $G$ must be preserved in the corresponding $f(u)$ and $f(u)$.\n",

From a human point of view the intuistive way to verify isomorphism between these graphs would have been as follows\n",

Zemylachenko (Zamylachenko, Korneeko & Tyshkevich 1985). Babai (2015) announced a quasipolynomial time algorithm for all graphs but however, retracted the quasipolynomial claim and stated a sub-exponential time bound instead after Harald Helfgott discovered a flaw in a proof (\"Graph Isomorphism Problem\", 2023). \n",

    "Polynomial time algorithms are considered to be efficient and viable for practical applications because of the huge difference between it and an exponential time algorithm. Thus programming tasks that needs to be performed frequently within a short period of time seem to have a polynomial time algorithms and when there is none, a brute-force exponential algorithm may be implemented where and when applicable. Also worth noting that polynomial-time algorithm definition is broad in the sense that an algorithm is also considered to run on polynomial time if it makes a polynomial-time number of calls to a polynomial-time complexity function or subroutine.\n",

In essense the graph ismorphism problem could be phrased in a less technical/mathematical form as `The search for an algorithm that can within a reasonable time, determine whether two given graphs are equivalent.` A reasonable time in this context would be a known upper bound influenced by the properties (complexity) of the given graphs.  \n",
